Although this was a fairly straigh forward assignment but due to the fact that i had not used django before i was not able to finish 
this assignment on time although i got 2 routes to work. 

1. GET http://localhost:8000/movies/

Calls the third party api https://demo.credy.in/api/v1/maya/movies/
and returns the requested page (list of movies)


2. POST http://localhost:8000/register/

Takes username and password and returns JWT token and username 
(although only jwt was required to be returned as per assignment instructions , due to lack of time not able to make required
modifications)


** If called for the next round i can make sure to have the project complete with all requirements
